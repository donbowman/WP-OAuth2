WP-OAuth2
=========

![](WP-OAuth2-icon.png)

A WordPress plugin that allows users to login or register by
authenticating with an existing Google, LinkedIn, Github, or
other account via OAuth 2.0. Easily drops into new or
existing sites, integrates with existing users.

Visit the [WordPress Plugin
Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-oauth2/) for more.

This plugin shares a background with [wp-oauth](https://github.com/perrybutler/WP-OAuth).

There are many other such plugins available for Wordpress.
The main difference here is there is no external service / SaaS component:
it entirely operates within your own site.

This is released under GPLv2 and is free (as in speech and also as in
beer). There is no 'premium' version.
